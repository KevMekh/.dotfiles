# .dotfiles
My .dotfiles configs

Run the below command replacing the text including <>
```
ln -s <absolute_path_to_current_file> <absolute_path_to_config_file>
```
Each folder includes README.md-files specifying the paths in my linux system. Eg. with Neovim:
```
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/neovim/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```
README.md-files in each folder also explains how to set the configs up if there are any extra steps.
